Tutorial
In the past challenges, we've encountered problems where we've had to determine the mean or maximum values of a numeric column or a range of numeric values. Using pandas, a function that's been helpful for us was df. describe(). This function does a great job summarizing the descriptive statistics of numerical columns in a pandas DataFrame.

But what if we wanted to visualize the descriptive statistics of a range of numeric values. What would be the most effective way?

The best plot for summarizing descriptive statistics would be a boxplot. A boxplot can visually provide us with the following information:

Median
Interquartile Range (IQR)
Q1
Q3
Q1 - 1.5*IQR
Q3 + 1.5*IQR
Outliers
Boxplot Example

plt.figure()
plt.boxplot(df.['numerical_data'])
plt.show()


Challenge
Create a boxplot to answer the following questions:

How many books have over 4000 pages?

Note: Do not use a fitler, use a boxplot.

What are the average ratings for books that have over 4000 pages?

Note: You can use a filter for question 2.



Questions:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("books.csv")


Solutions: 

df.info()
df.describe()

#1. How many books have over 4000 pages?
# use boxplot to see outlier
plt.figure()
plt.boxplot(df['num_pages'])
plt.show()

#1. How many books have over 4000 pages?
#2. What are the average ratings for books that have over 4000 pages?
# use filter to select
filter_1 = (df['num_pages'] > 4000)
df[filter_1]



Key takeaway:

how to use matplotlib draw a boxplot 

plt.figure()
plt.boxplot(df['numeric_columns'])
plt.show()
