Tutorial
An important concept in data analysis that you should become familiar with is data filtering. We can think about filtering as a two step process. The first step is creating a boolean condition that works as a filter, and the second step is passing through the filter to the data.

#Example - Loading Data
df = pd.read_csv('avocado.csv')
df = df.drop(columns = ['Unnamed: 0'])
df.head()

#Step 1: Create filter
user_filter = df['AveragePrice'] >= 1.30

#Step 2: Feed the filter in original DataFrame and store in new variable
filtered_df = df[user_filter]


Challenge
Examining the numbers, Dot understands that the prices of both conventional and organic avocados rise and fall frequently. No matter how they grow the avocados, they don't want to sell them for less than $2.

Looking at recent years, Dot needs you to help them find: in which year or years did both conventional and organic avocados have had average prices above $2?

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('avocado.csv', index_col = 0)
df.head()



Solutions:

filter_1 = (df['AveragePrice'] > 2)
df[filter_1].groupby(['year','type']).count()



Key takeaway:

use df[filter] and df.groupbu() function to select data
