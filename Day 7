#example dicitonary
user_boxes = {'weight': [4,2,18,21,14,13],
              'box_name': ['box1','box2', 'box3', 'box4', 'box5', 'box6']
             }
             
             
 sort from the lightest to the heaviest
 
 Solution 1:
 import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(user_boxes)
sorted_df = df.sort_values(['weight'])

print(sorted_df['box_name'])


Solution 2: (Bubble sorting)

bubble sorting iterates the list and finds the biggest number to put it at the end of the list
2nd largest number to the 2nd end position
3rd largest number to the 3rd end position...

so there involves 2 loops, one exteral loop, one internal loop(swaping 2 numbers, if the pervious on is bigger)


# Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity
# Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm

list_1 = [8,5,6,1,77,9,456,3,5,8,1,3546,8,5,66]


def bubble_sort():
    
    for i in range(len(list_1)-1,0,-1):
        for n in range(i):

            if list_1[n] > list_1[n+1]:

                temp = list_1[n] # use a temp variable to assign the larger value
                list_1[n] = list_1[n+1] # swap the 2 values
                list_1[n+1] = temp # reassign the larger value
            
    return list_1

bubble_sort()
