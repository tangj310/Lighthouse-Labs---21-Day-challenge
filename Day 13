Tutorial
Today we will be covering two essential pandas functions that will supercharge your data analytics abilities.

df.sort_values()
df.value_counts()
The pandas.sort_values() allows us to reorder our dataframe in an ascending or descending order given a column for pandas to work from. This is similar to the excel sort function.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')
df


df.sort_values(by=['pH'], ascending = True)


Challenge
Use the pandas sort function and the pandas filter function from the previous challenge to answer these questions:

Which wines had a quality of 8 or higher and a residual sugar level above 5?
How many wines in total had a quality of 8 and 7 and a citric acid level below 0.4?
Note: Use the index positions of the wines as the wine names.

import pandas as pd
wine_df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')
wine_df.head()





Solutions:

# Which wines had a quality of 8 or higher and a residual sugar level above 5?
filter_1 = (wine_df['quality'] >= 8)&(wine_df['residual sugar'] > 5) 
wine_df[filter_1]

# How many wines in total had a quality of 8 and 7 and a citric acid level below 0.4?
filter_2 = (wine_df['quality'] == 8)|(wine_df['quality'] == 7)
(wine_df[filter_2]['citric acid'] < 0.4).value_counts()



Key takeaways:
df.sort_values()
df.value_counts()
