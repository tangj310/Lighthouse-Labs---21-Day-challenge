Tutorial
While working with data, we may want to figure out the frequency distribution of a numerical dataset. The frequency distribution refers to how often each value occurs within a dataset. This can be important to know so that we can understand whether the data we are analyzing is normally distributed or skewed.

The best way to visualize the distribution of our dataset is with a histogram. Histograms are a graphical representation of data using bars of different heights. Similar to bar charts, histograms group numbers into buckets. The size of each bar shows how many fall into each range.

Building a histogram with MatPlotLib

Here is how a histogram can be built using Matplotlib:

plt.figure()
plt.hist(df['numerical_data'], bins = 40) #Play around with the bin sizes when plotting your histogram
plt.show()

Challenge
What type of distribution does the column avg_time have?

Do games that have a great avg_rating have longer play times?

Note: For question 2, filter out games that have are above the avg_rating of 9.0.

Stretch

As an optional bonus question, try answering:

1. What type of distribution does weight have?

2. What happens to the median and mean of a skewed distribution?



Questions:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv('boardgames.csv')
df.head(3)

#What type of distribution does the column avg_time have?
# use the min/max to find out the histograms range
print(df['avg_time'].min())
print(df['avg_time'].max())

plt.figure()
plt.hist(df['avg_time'], bins = 10,range=(0,500)) #Play around with the bin sizes when plotting your histogram
plt.show()


#Do games that have a great avg_rating have longer play times?
filter_1 = (df['avg_rating'] >= 9)
df_1 = df[filter_1]

plt.figure()
plt.hist(df_1['avg_time'],bins = 10,range=(0,600))
plt.show()
