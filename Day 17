Challenge
Help Dot by answering the following questions using a bar plot:

What are the top 5 rated books in the dataset?

What are the top 5 books with the highest average rating?

Note: Filter out books that have low ratings_count, for question 2 filter out books with a ratings_count less than the mean.


Question:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv("books.csv")

df.head(2)


#Solution
top_rated = df.sort_values('ratings_count', ascending = False).head(5)
top_rated

plt.figure()
plt.barh(top_rated['title'], top_rated['ratings_count'])
plt.show()

top_ratings_filter = df.ratings_count > df.ratings_count.mean()
top_ratings = df[top_ratings_filter]
top_ratings = top_ratings.sort_values('average_rating', ascending = False).head()
top_ratings

plt.figure()
plt.barh(top_ratings['title'], top_ratings['average_rating'])
plt.show()
